Xper-beta
=========

My first encounter with systematic and bioinformatics append few years ago while I was starting my master degree. One of the courses I took was taught by Dr. Jacques Lebbe. This class has been like a revelation and it influenced my subsequent choices in my academic life. I re-implemented Xper for a personal use and in memory of Jacques Lebbe.
